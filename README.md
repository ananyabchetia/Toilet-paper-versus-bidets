# Flush out the truth: Will you roll with Toilet paper or bidets?

I look into the toilet paper versus bidets debate and report on why residents in the U.S prefer toilet paper over bidets, despite the enviromental and health concerns of using paper.

## Design

I relied on this <a href="https://codepen.io/tsimenis/pen/xVPLjp">code</a> to create the smooth transition from the header to the text. If you are also interested in these header designs and transitions, go to <a href="https://www.sliderrevolution.com/resources/css-header/">Slider Revolution</a>! These websites are really helpful to gain inspiration on how to layout my piece.

I hand drew the types of bidets and the pictogram via procreate

I previously installed fonts from <a href="https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en-us/help/ultratax-cs/get-started/install-and-update/reinstall-fonts">Rueters</a>. I relied on the newsroom's fonts, specifically for my title card.

## Data collecting and analysis

Like a lot of my reporting, I looked at this subject through a business and climate reporting lens. I relied on company earning call transcripts, trade companies and business reports to write about the company's financial performance, strategies and views on the consumer goods industry.

To convey the severity of climate change, I used the EPAâ€™s <a href="https://www.epa.gov/energy/greenhouse-gas-equivalencies-calculator">Greenhouse Gas Equivalencies Calculator</a> to translate emission rates into relatable metrics like car or plane emissions.

This <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IOBDcixSgD5Lgz2gT3UmPb0i4EIvI4bs/view?pli=1">study</a> provides data on emission rates and estimated tree loss when producing toilet paper in the U.S and beyond. I scraped the pdf using pdfplumber to collect the data and represent it in my writing and pictograms.

## Challenges

There was a unique but exciting challenge of having sources share their stories. Toilet talk is fun, but not everyone is ready to share their story. I learned to explain the importance of this piece to sources and I am grateful to them for sharing their story!

Data collection was slightly difficult as there is not a vast amount of reeseatch on the toilet paper market, the enviromental impacts of toilet paper and the preference of toilet paper versus bidets. That being said, I relied on Google Trends data to show the popularity of bidet searches, the 2022 study and nonprofits that provided the latest statistics on tree loss from toilet paper.

## Gratitude

Thank you to my sources and to png.com for providing the first images you see on the title card!
